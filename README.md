# Prodigy_CS_04
This Python program implements a simple keylogger that records keystrokes and saves them to a specified text file. It features a colorful ASCII art header displayed in green. The program runs in the background, logging all keypresses until the ESC key is pressed, prompting the user to enter a filename for saving the logs.
